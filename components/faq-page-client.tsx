          answer:
            "Our management fee is $150 per month flat fee - no percentage of rent! This is significantly lower than traditional companies that charge 8-12% of monthly rent. For example, on a $3,000/month property, you save over $2,000 annually compared to 10% management fees. Additional units have portfolio discounts.",

          question: "How do your fees compare to other companies?",
